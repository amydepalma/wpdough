WPdough: A Wordpress Starter Kit

## Local Development

Boot your local WordPress install and run `npm run start` from the theme to start `parcel` which watches and builds the following directories and files, forcing hot reloads on saved changes.

-   `assets/scss/main.scss`
-   `assets/scss/editor.scss`
-   All Javascript files inside `assets/js/`
-   All assets inside `asset/images`

### Building

Run `npm run build` from the theme directory to compile assets for production
